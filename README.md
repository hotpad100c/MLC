This is a client-side mod, which means you don't need to install it on a server. 
It can automatically output statements in the chat bar at specified intervals according to the configuration file,
acting on behalf of the player. You can use it to pretend to sing on a server, prank friends, automate commands,
or even in single-player worlds to execute multiple commands with a single command. 
This can be very useful for things like Redstone designs.
